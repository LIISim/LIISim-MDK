# LIISim-MDK
LIISim - Model Development Kit (MDK)

This model development kit was written in MATLAB for comparison and validation of the integrity of the implemented algorithms of the LIISim 3 Desktop version (C++). For the MDK the same class structure is used and the functionalities are limited to simulation of temperature traces using the same heat-transfer models and databases as of the C++ version. The MDK can be used for testing and developing new models before they are integrated in the LIISim framework.
